# Library Database CRUD Project

## About
This project, developed for the **Performance Test – Module 4 (SQL Databases)** by Bibliosoft, addresses the data management challenges faced by the Central Library of Colombia. The library currently stores bibliographic and loan data across multiple disorganized Excel files, making data search and analysis difficult. This solution organizes this data into a normalized SQL database, provides CSV bulk loading, a CRUD system, a minimal dashboard, and advanced query support.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze and normalize provided Excel data to 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF.
- Build a hand-created relational model (not autogenerated).
- Create and configure the SQL database schema using English naming.
- Load data in bulk from CSV.
- Implement CRUD operations and a simple dashboard for one entity.
- Provide advanced SQL queries via API (to be tested via Postman).
- Deliver comprehensive documentation in README in English.

---

## Prerequisites
To run this project locally, you need:
- Node.js (v18+)
- MySQL or MariaDB (v8+)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Git
- (Optional) Postman for testing

---

## Technologies
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: MySQL / MariaDB
- Frontend (dashboard): HTML and CSS (Bootstrap, Tailwind, or Bulma)
- Diagram: Draw.io (ER diagram in MER.jpg)
- Testing: Postman
- Data handling: Excel → CSV

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/angelicacvo/Data-base-test.git
   cd Data-base-test
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create the database by running:

   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p < database_creation.sql
   ```

4. Load CSV data into the database using the provided script.

5. Start the server:

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

6. Open the dashboard in your browser:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

7. Test the API and advanced queries via Postman.

## Entity-Relationship Model (ERM)

The data model was normalized to **3NF**. The entities and relationships are depicted in the included ER diagram:

### Normalization Justification:

* **First Normal Form (1NF):** Each field contains atomic values; no repeating groups.
* **Second Normal Form (2NF):** Partial dependencies removed by separating independent entities.
* **Third Normal Form (3NF):** Eliminated transitive dependencies by structuring relationships clearly.

## CSV Bulk Load Process

1. Convert Excel `.xlsx` file to CSV.
2. Run the provided loading script to insert data into the database.
3. Validate for duplicates and maintain foreign key consistency.
4. Documented in the readme and the project.

## CRUD System & Dashboard

* CRUD operations implemented for one entity (e.g., **users**).
* Validations are included in API endpoints.
* Dashboard allows simple interaction for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.

### Recommended HTTP Status Codes:

* `200 OK` – Successful GET
* `201 Created` – Successful POST (new record)
* `204 No Content` – Successful DELETE
* `400 Bad Request` – Validation error
* `404 Not Found` – Resource not found
* `500 Internal Server Error` – Unhandled failure

---

## Advanced Queries (via Postman)

Three essential queries are implemented and can be tested using the Postman collection:

1. **Books borrowed per user** – Shows total loans per user.
2. **Overdue loans** – Lists overdue loans with user and book details.
3. **Books by author** – Displays books by a specific author with year and availability.

The Postman collection (`.json`) with endpoints for CRUD and these queries is included in the repository.
